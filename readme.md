# Network Device Management and Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The Network Device Management and Monitoring System is a comprehensive application designed to manage, monitor, and analyze network devices connected to a Windows Mobile Hotspot. The application provides functionalities for scanning the network, managing device information, monitoring network traffic, and capturing network packets. It features a user-friendly graphical interface built with **PyQt6**, making it accessible for users to interact with and manage their network devices efficiently.

## Key Features

### Device Management
- Load and save devices from a JSON file.
- Normalize MAC addresses for consistent formatting.
- Add or update device details (name, IP address, vendor, model).
- Remove devices that are no longer needed.
- Retrieve stored information for specific devices.
- Merge new scan data with existing device information.

### Network Scanning
- Check if the Windows Mobile Hotspot is active and retrieve its IP address.
- Scan the network for connected devices and retrieve their IP and MAC addresses.
- Resolve hostnames for identified IP addresses.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **Device Table:** Displays device details such as name, IP address, MAC address, vendor, model, status, and last seen time.
- **Context Menu:** Options to refresh device information, forget devices, and start packet capture.
- **Device Editor:** Dialog for editing device details.

- **Packet Capture Dialog:** Interface for configuring and starting packet captures.
- **IDS Monitor Panel:** Monitors network traffic and sets thresholds for data rates.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Monitor network traffic and track data rates for devices.
- Configure data rate thresholds for individual devices and receive alerts for threshold breaches.

### Packet Capture
- Start and stop packet captures for network traffic analysis.
- Display the status of packet captures for individual devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **GUI Framework:** PyQt6  
- **Network Scanning:** Subprocess and ARP  
- **Data Storage:** JSON  
- **Additional Libraries:** PyQtGraph for traffic graph visualization

## Code Structure and Organization
The codebase is organized into several directories and key files:

### Root Directory
- **main.py**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the PyQt6 application and opens the main window.
- **Captures/**: Stores network capture files containing raw network data from packet capture sessions.
- **device_data.json**: Stores network device information such as names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, vendors, models, and statuses.
- **logs/**: Contains log files generated by the application.

### Src/
- **data/device_manager.py**: Manages device information (load, save, update, and merge device data).
- **network/device_scanner.py**: Scans the network for devices and retrieves IP/MAC addresses and hostnames.
- **network/packet_capture.py**: Captures network packets for analysis.
- **ids/ids_manager.py**: Handles IDS configurations, monitors traffic, and triggers alerts.
- **ui/device_editor.py**: Dialog for editing device details.
- **ui/ids_monitor.py**: Interface for monitoring traffic and setting data rate thresholds.
- **ui/main_window.py**: Main user interface for managing devices and scanning the network.
- **ui/packet_capture_dialog.py**: Configures and starts packet captures.

### venv/
Contains the virtual environment with all dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Future Enhancements
Enhanced Security: Implement additional security measures for network monitoring and device management.
Advanced Analytics: Integrate advanced analytics for network traffic and device behavior.
Cross-Platform Support: Extend support to other operating systems beyond Windows.
User Authentication: Add user authentication and role-based access control.
